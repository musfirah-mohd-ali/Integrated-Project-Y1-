## Design Process
So the colour scheme was chosen because we wanted to mix both our favourites colours being blue and green. We also chose our colour scheme as after doing research, we found that travel agencies use earthy and sky-ish tones to relate back to air travel and land travel such as airplanes and trains. Our logo is a luggage bag with a silhouette of an airplane. This is to symbolize the different stages of travel such as the packing of clothing before your flight and the actual travelling on the vessel itself.

Next our website is inspired by a combination of other travel websites, such as Chan Brothers and Fayyaz Travels. Firstly, we chose the UI to look simple so that our users are not distracted by things such as ads or pop ups. Secondly, we chose this layout design to emphasize functionality over complex aesthetics to allow users a simple way of navigating our site.
