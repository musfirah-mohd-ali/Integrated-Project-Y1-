# Musli Travels
Musli Travels is an e-commerce travel agency website that allows its users to purchase tours and travel items in an all-in-one transaction. Our website allows users to earn points from each transaction, enabling them to buy travel products from our shop without spending an extra dime. Furthermore, users can gift their friends any travel products from our shop using their points.

## User Audience Intent and Purpose
### Who is the website catering for?
Our website is curated for new travelers who are not familiar with the places they want to travel to and need a bit of help planning their itineraries. Our website is also for those who want to buy travel essentials such as luggage bags and neck pillows without the hassle of going to another website.
### Purpose and Value Provided:
1. Travellers
    * Simple and convinient way to book their holiday destination which includes iteneraries and miscellaneous items.
    * Simplifies travel for big families or groups so that they don't have to plan out the trip themselves.
    * Givens travellers a variety of destinations so that they are not limited to the basic travel destinations.
2. Airlines and hotels
    * Provides easier communication between the traveller and the hotels/airlines.
    * Helps them gain more customers without having to promote themselves as much.
    * They still earn revenue even though the traveller cancelled their plans as our company is the middleman handling all the transactions. 

## Design Process
The color scheme was chosen because we wanted to mix both of our favorite colors, blue and green. We also selected this color scheme after conducting research, as we found that travel agencies typically use earthy and sky-like tones to relate to air travel and land travel, such as airplanes and trains. Our logo is a luggage bag with a silhouette of an airplane. This symbolizes the different stages of travel, such as the packing of clothing before your flight and the actual traveling on the vessel itself.

Our websiteâ€™s design is inspired by a combination of other travel websites, such as Chan Brothers and Fayyaz Travels. Firstly, we chose a simple UI to ensure that our users are not distracted by ads or pop-ups. Secondly, we selected this layout design to emphasize functionality over complex aesthetics, allowing users a straightforward way to navigate our site.
